The changes in the i3WM config are the color palette and the gaps.

Polybar theme is taken from [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes), where I enabled some modules, or moved others (time, window title, keyboard)

Alacritty theme: Monokai

Packages necessary:
- flameshot
- polybar
- alacritty

Host system... shhhh
